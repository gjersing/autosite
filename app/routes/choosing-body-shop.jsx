      <p>
        After a car accident or collision, choosing the right auto body shop is
        one of the most important decisions you'll make. Your vehicle is a
        significant investment, and you want to ensure it's repaired correctly
        by professionals you can trust. In Medford, Oregon, there are several
        auto body shops to choose from, but not all are created equal. Here's
        what you should look for when selecting an auto body shop.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Check for Certifications and Training</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the first things to look for is whether the shop's technicians
        are certified. I-CAR (Inter-Industry Conference on Auto Collision
        Repair) certification is the gold standard in the industry. I-CAR
        certified technicians have undergone extensive training in the latest
        repair techniques and technologies. This certification ensures that the
        technicians working on your vehicle are up-to-date with current repair
        methods and safety standards. At Sky Auto Body, all our technicians are
        I-CAR certified, giving you peace of mind that your vehicle is in
        capable hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Look for Experience and Reputation</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Experience matters when it comes to auto body repair. Look for a shop
        that has been in business for several years and has a solid reputation
        in the community. Check online reviews on Google, Yelp, and other review
        platforms. While a few negative reviews are normal, pay attention to how
        the shop responds to criticism and whether the majority of reviews are
        positive. A reputable shop will have a history of satisfied customers
        and will be willing to provide references if asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify Insurance Partnerships</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're filing an insurance claim, it's important to work with a shop
        that has established relationships with major insurance companies. A
        shop that works directly with insurance companies can handle the billing
        and paperwork for you, making the process much smoother. At Sky Auto
        Body, we work with all major insurance providers including State Farm,
        Geico, Progressive, Allstate, Farmers, USAA, Travelers, Nationwide,
        Liberty Mutual, and American Family. This means we can handle your claim
        from start to finish, reducing your stress and paperwork.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ask About Warranties</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A quality auto body shop will stand behind its work with comprehensive
        warranties. Ask about warranty coverage for both collision repair work
        and paint/refinishing services. At Sky Auto Body, we offer a lifetime
        warranty on all refinishing services, meaning if the paint we apply ever
        fades, peels, or fails due to workmanship or materials, we'll fix it at
        no charge. This level of warranty protection demonstrates our confidence
        in the quality of our work.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Consider the Shop's Equipment and Facilities</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Modern vehicles require modern equipment. A quality auto body shop
        should have up-to-date equipment including frame straightening machines,
        computerized paint matching systems, and proper paint booths with
        controlled environments. The shop should also be clean and
        well-organized – this often reflects the level of care they'll take with
        your vehicle. When you visit Sky Auto Body, you'll see our
        state-of-the-art facility and equipment designed to handle everything
        from minor dents to major collision repairs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Get Multiple Estimates</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's always a good idea to get estimates from multiple shops before
        making a decision. However, remember that the lowest price isn't always
        the best choice. Look at what's included in each estimate and compare
        the quality of work, warranties, and customer service. A slightly higher
        price may be worth it if it comes with better service, stronger
        warranties, and more experienced technicians. At Sky Auto Body, we offer
        free estimates with no appointment necessary, making it easy for you to
        get the information you need to make an informed decision.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Check for Local Ownership</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Locally owned and operated businesses often provide more personalized
        service and have a stronger commitment to the community. They're more
        likely to go the extra mile to ensure customer satisfaction because
        their reputation in the local community matters. Sky Auto Body is a
        locally owned and operated business in Medford, Oregon, and we take
        pride in serving our neighbors with honest, quality service.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ask About Turnaround Time</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        While you don't want to rush quality work, it's reasonable to ask about
        estimated turnaround times. A professional shop should be able to give
        you a realistic timeline based on the extent of damage and parts
        availability. They should also keep you updated throughout the repair
        process. Communication is key – you should feel comfortable asking
        questions and receiving updates about your vehicle's repair status.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Trust Your Instincts</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, trust your instincts. When you visit a shop, pay attention to
        how you're treated. Are the staff friendly and willing to answer your
        questions? Do they seem knowledgeable and professional? Do you feel
        comfortable leaving your vehicle with them? If something doesn't feel
        right, it's okay to look elsewhere. You should feel confident that the
        shop you choose will treat your vehicle with the same care they would
        treat their own.
      </p>
      <p>
